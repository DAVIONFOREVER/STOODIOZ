# Stoodioz Admin Dashboard

This directory contains the complete source code for the Stoodioz back-office application.

It is a standalone React application, separate from the main user-facing app, designed for administrators to manage users, bookings, finances, and content on the platform.

## Running the Admin App

To run this application, you would typically point your development server to `admin/index.html`. It has its own `index.tsx` entry point and component structure.
