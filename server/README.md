# Stoodioz Backend Foundation

This directory contains the foundational plans for the Stoodioz backend application, including the database schemas.

## `schemas.ts`

This file defines the data models for our application. Think of it as the blueprint for our database. It outlines the structure for every piece of data, such as users, stoodioz, bookings, and reviews, and defines the relationships between them.

This is the first critical step in building a real, scalable backend. The next steps will be:

1.  **Build the API:** Create API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/bookings`, `GET /api/stoodioz/:id`) that use these schemas to interact with the database.
2.  **Refactor the Frontend:** Update the React components to fetch data from our new API instead of using the mock data from `constants.ts`.
